in my country Vietnam people generally have a deep appreciation for art
 as it is closely tied to our cultural identity and history
 traditional art forms like
 Silk painting
 water puppetry

 art is also increasingly being

 public spaces such as
 murals in urban areas
 which inspire a sense of community and bride

 art is viewed not only as a means of artistic aesthetic expression
 but
 also uh as a bridge
 that connects cast
 the past present and future
