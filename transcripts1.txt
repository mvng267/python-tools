1 Hotel I used to stay at was hotel by the name of Naman in Converse City I usually my family usually stay there during stormy nights when we can't go home on a topic if I like staying in hotels it depends on the hotel itself I usually like it because they have very modern facilities bathrooms lights and comfortable bedrooms
 yeah but I do think hotels are sometimes overpriced because when I say that number Hotel they charge us for 1 1 million Vietnamese Dong for a single night so I won't recommend staying too long

 I also appreciate that many articles were very references and shocking allowing me to dig deeper into to to base even
 the color of the right to nature of Wikipedia is another reason and enjoy
 users run on over the world contribute to the side
 continuously updating and improving the content
 this means I can often find the latest information on different WebEx still on topic
 I frequently returned to Wikipedia because it is a reliable starting phone for research and learning
 it's a use of friendly player making easy to navigate
 and the first of information a variable in in fresh
 whether I'm referring for a last exploring a new interest or just satisfying my curiosity
 Wikipedia is an invaluable resource that I rarely on regularly

in my country Vietnam people generally have a deep appreciation for art
 as it is closely tied to our cultural identity and history
 traditional art forms like
 Silk painting
 water puppetry
 or cherished as a way of preserving our heritage
 art is also increasingly being
 integrated into
 public spaces such as
 murals in urban areas
 which inspire a sense of community and bride
 in my opinion why not everyone
 engages actively with art
 on a personal level
 there is a growing recognition of its importance
 in you know fostering creativity
 and uh emotional well-being
 overall
 art is viewed not only as a means of artistic aesthetic expression
 but
 also uh as a bridge
 that connects cast
 the past present and future

 significantly improve people people's Health uh the first thing that pop up if I buy is
 the innovation of health records trackers such as the Smartwatch the uh smart Health men's

if I had to talk about someone fascinating it would definitely be Nikola Tesla
 he was such an interesting and unique person also brilliant and also a little eccentric he had this incredible imagination and could picture entire inventions in his head before even building them people say he had a photographic memory and he was so discipline
 um discipline
 yeah this discipline that he worked almost starts off acting sleeping only a couple of of hours a night but despite his genius though he wasn't very good with money and he struggled financially for most of his life which is also sad concerning how much he contributed to the world like AC currents and uh a lot of other things
 he was also quite quirky
 Yeah so basically your typical scientist she was obsessed with the number 3 hated pros and even care deeply for Pigeon 1 saying he loved 1 like it was his own child but what I'm admired most about Tesla is his vision he wasn't trying to create things to make money he genuinely wanted to change the world and make life better for everyone even though he didn't want he didn't always get the recognition he deserved in his lifetime he he's remembered today as 1 of the greatest inventor in history and in the world

um when it comes to a famous scientist the first person to come to my mind is Albert Einstein who is World widely known as a physicist however that doesn't stop him from uh being a master at other areas such as mathematics and uh
 chemistry with that in mind we can say that he knows a lot in multiple areas instead of just his own and mentioning him we cannot mention about his uh famous formula which
 result which involve of the relationship between energy and weight so apparently uh with his formula we know Humanity have know that
 in every matters even in air and oxygen that we breathe in their exist a form of energy but we just don't know how to squish out those energy and use it in life
 but
 but since we know it everyone is chasing here
 his relics and trying to solve uh
 the mystery of switching out
 Power from Just
 a simple matters and there's an interesting about him that I have known is that he when he was young his he was looked down by everyone because no 1 understand what he was talking about but turns out it was actually because he was too smart and everyone cannot understand what he was saying is because they are not as smart as him
 and with the formula he slept he's outside that he's the future of humanity where we can find a alternative energy better than fossil fuel which is harming the Earth in many way

a very famous artists
 that really loves to be fascinated with his invention is Mr Edison who is the father to the modern-day light bulbs we are using
 so asking the question whether they are important I think it is needless to answer that because of course 100%
 um light bulbs are really important since
 they are such otherworldly Innovative idea at the moment they were invented because
 light bulbs the nighttime
 can be lifted and
 with them Thomas Edison really did lights up the whole world and
 when the Sun goes down
 And that is really crucial to the
 to various Industries and of course to your personal life too
 like the invention of your like Bob's really smart
 really marks the selfless works of the scientists and
 Thomas Ed
 uh Thomas Edison is 1 of them since I've read somewhere that he worked selflessly like he only sleep for 2 or 3 hours per day which is really insufficient for a decent human
 and yeah there are some rumors about him that he stole the original idea from Tesla but
 for me that is not really important in terms of general science since they all contributed to a better good
 for
 community and humidity

 there was some uh back in sixth grade the main subject we learned for science for
 um mainly astronomy and geography and I really I was really uh fascinated by the concept of astronomy and how the stars and um
 Moon work
 and I I just think of uh it's just really
 cool that there's a whole different world out there that we don't know and it's just waiting for us to explore it to study it to understand it just even slightly grasp a concept of it and it's right out there and it cons it consumes our world and yet we do not have a clear understanding of what it is
 and that's what uh that's my favorite branch of science

um I don't really have any practical use of
 science but I mainly just study it in school and um
 for example if I study um biology I I have a understanding of cells and the human body but I don't really know how to apply that to my real daily life or anything in my life at all I just understand how it works and simply
 just grasp the basic concept of it not really how my how I should I could operate on someone or the type of medicine I could take on my own I still rely on a medical professional or a doctor to prescribe me medicine or do operate uh operate a s surgery

definitely based on observation um most of my friends prefer
 science to art and literature and I think the main reason probably come from universities most of the universities may favor uh some faculties which involve um stem subjects so yeah why don't we just go straight to learn that and take that Advantage right
