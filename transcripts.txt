in my country Vietnam people generally have a deep appreciation for art
 as it is closely tied to our cultural identity and history
 traditional art forms like
 Silk painting
 water puppetry
 or cherished as a way of preserving our heritage
 art is also increasingly being
 integrated into
 public spaces such as
 murals in urban areas
 which inspire a sense of community and bride
 in my opinion why not everyone
 engages actively with art
 on a personal level
 there is a growing recognition of its importance
 in you know fostering creativity
 and uh emotional well-being
 overall
 art is viewed not only as a means of artistic aesthetic expression
 but
 also uh as a bridge
 that connects cast
 the past present and future

I must say that I don't really know a lot of plays around my neighborhood but there's 1 that I would consider a less crowded place that what it is I am I playground just a really small 1 by the intersection and it is really near to my house so getting there is really easy and although it it can be really crowded at during the day since it is obviously a playground and children who comes there to play every day as well as their parents to supervise them
 but when it whenever um when the knights come they have to parents are usually their parents are usually busy so they have to keep their kids with them so no 1 would be at the playground so
 whenever I come there it is like the whole playground is mine and
 and I can do whatever I want there and but
 and by opposite of that playground is a noodle store
 which is I would say really normal if it's it's not at night when it comes there and
 and because it sell it sells food during a really late of the night it is really a rare signs resin for me to say that everyone's after a hardworking day get get in a meal and although the noodles
 is really simple
 it's a p really delicious when they eat it
 and also since it is a really peaceful place I can study it really easily
 and that's in fact what I do I always go to the playground whenever I need to concentrate on my homework

 actually enjoy history I think that um it will satisfy their curiosity with with uh is historical buildings such as uh Japan temples and the and it's all stories
 hi there is this is that a lot of in underrated attractions and it's a it's a perfect uh place for you to unwind in your mind after a really long period of stress and it's so perfect for a getaway um after all I think I have seen that the government Overlook Overlook at uh tourism so that that's the reason why they hinder Lan from becoming a famous uh tourism attraction
 and the transportation system there is not really good and not really well developed so that's the reason why I think that you should try
 to go to linto
